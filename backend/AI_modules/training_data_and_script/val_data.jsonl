What kind of movies do you like?\nCustomer: I like romantic comedies a lot.\nAgent: Why do you like this kind of movie?\nCustomer: I really love comedies, so I like the aspect that it's you know, funny, lighthearted, but I also love romances, so the combination is great. You basically get a happy ending in all of the movies, and it's usually just a feel good movie. It's a good time, and it's a nice escape.\nAgent: Can you name a particular romantic comedy that you like?\nCustomer: Sure, like The Holiday is one of my absolute favorites.\nAgent: What are the 2 things that you like about this movie?\nCustomer: The cast of the movie is fantastic, like couldn't have been better, and it's Jude Law and Cameron Diaz and it just It's It's It's so good. And the The The script The storyline of the whole movie is so well done. It's so well written, but it's also It's much more original\nCustomer: than we usually get in a romantic comedy. It has two love stories in it, not one. It has some unexpected heartwarming aspects to it involving other characters, as well. It's just a delight.\nAgent: Can you name a movie that you dislike?\nCustomer: A romantic comedy that I dislike?\nCustomer: Thou Be True, it's terrible.\nAgent: What are the 2 things that you dislike about this movie?\nCustomer: It was So part of the problem was how it was billed. It was billed as a romantic comedy. That's how they advertised it, that's how they showed it, and that's how they acted like it was going to be when they started the movie. But it was really more of a gross out comedy, which was kind of popular at the time, I guess. And So you went in expecting a romantic comedy, and you What was really happening was sort of like taking comedy to the extreme in a very\nCustomer: funny and sort of gross out juvenile manner. It was a mess. The second thing I really hate about it really the lead actor. Gerard Butler is sorely miscast. He just is not good for romantic comedies at all. He doesn't pull off any aspect of what you want out of a romantic He's not like good at lighthearted. He's not funny. And I guess he's good looking, but it doesn't really\nCustomer: It's not like that in a handsome way I guess.\nAgent: Other than the casting of Gerald Butler, can you name a third reason?\nCustomer: Sure. Just in general, the movie itself is poorly written. It's like it was\nCustomer: I guess, I think probably trying too hard to be too many things, it certainly wasn't a romantic comedy and it was written in a way that one, I didn't laugh once, and two, the comedy they were going for was a wrong kind of comedy for romantic comedy.\nAgent: Do you like the movie Black Klansman?\nCustomer: Oh, I haven't seen that yet, but that's That's got to be a good one.\nAgent: Do you like the movie Spotlight?\nCustomer: I mean it's an excellent film, it's not something that I would re-watch again but it's an important film and really well done.\nAgent: Can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?\nCustomer: It is\nCustomer: a really good ensemble cast. Sometimes it's hard to do an ensemble movie because there could be weak links throughout the cast, but this is one that is all around solid and the screenplay is exceptional. It is really well written, really well done and really captures the the true story that it was writing about and the\nCustomer: And it pulls off what they were trying to accomplish in terms of capturing the importance of a story that they needed to tell.\nAgent: Do you like the movie Jurassic World?\nCustomer: I haven't see it, but I But that kind of movie is okay. I have seen the original Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 2. And i do like the general feel of them, but those can tend to be a bit scary too, so I'm not sure if Jurassic World would be good for me, but I would see it.\nAgent: Last question: can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?\nCustomer: I like action movies, and it's basically an action movie, so it has that sort of aspect of being exciting and kind of edge of your seat and you know, keeping you going from start to finish, so that's good. And then I do like the cast that they have in Jurassic World. I think they sort of I think they nailed it for sort of that sort of summer block\nCustomer: so that's always great, and all of the Jurassic Park movies have fantastic visual effects, so it's a big budget movie. But it's big budget for a reason, they really get the feel of the dinosaurs and everything is so much more realistic than you'd think. And it really helps to carry off what they're going for in a movie.\nAgent: Thank you. You give the best critiques!

So like Love Adores is a easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It is It has actually a very good cast, but the script and whatever they are trying to do in a movie is so flawed.

One of my favorite movies is The Fall.

It's beautifully filmed. It was filmed, I think in over 20 countries. It was filmed by a director called Tarsem Singh, if I say his name right. And I believe he financed most of it. It was sort of his pet project, and I like the story. But it's just beautifully\nCustomer: A particular movie, I can't think off the top of my head, but in general I'm not a huge fan of comedies. Well, actually I can think of one.

It's not my kind of comedy.\nAgent: Ok, then have you seen the movie The Martian\nCustomer: I did see that movie.\nAgent: What is it about this kind of movies that you like or dislike?\nCustomer: The Martian was a little slow, I will have to say. It wasn't terrible or anything. I like sci-fi movies, but it was just slow. It got a little boring in parts. If I was going to pick a sci-fi movie that came out around that same time period, I would've picked Interstellar. I think it had a better story and more meaning. And just was more interesting\nCustomer: Although, I believe the motion was more to the book and not necessarily I wouldn't say to the book, but to how it would surely be to be stuck up on more by yourself eventually.\nAgent: Wonderful. thank you for sharing.
